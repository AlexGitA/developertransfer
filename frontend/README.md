Frontend setup

# Notes

Hi, I checked the [linked
reference](https://medium.com/@miahossain8888/how-to-install-and-configure-tailwind-css-in-react-13accc4c5b4b),
but noticed they refer to React rather than React Native. I'm not a mobile
developer so I used the following scaffolding tool to create the files and
then copied them into the project using the existing file structure.

```sh
npx create-expo-stack@latest my-expo-app --nativewind
```
